This script retrieves player data from a DraftKings API endpoint, extracts first names and last names of players, and stores the information in a CSV file.

Prerequisites
json library for handling JSON data
requests library for making HTTP requests
pandas library for data manipulation and CSV export

Usage
1. Import required libraries:

import json
import requests
import pandas as pd

2. Define the URL of the DraftKings API endpoint:
url = 'https://api.draftkings.com/nftgames/v1/players?format=json&sportId=1&rarity=Core&leagueSeasonId=2359&slateRepresentativeDraftGroupId=&weekNumber=1'

3. Make an HTTP GET request to the API and decode the response:
res = requests.get(url)
response = res.content.decode("utf-8")

4. Parse the JSON response into a Python dictionary:
players = json.loads(response)

5. Initialize an empty list to store player names:
names = []

6. Loop through the player data and extract first names and last names:

for player in players['playerRows']:
    first_name = player.get('firstName')
    last_name = player.get('lastName')
    names.append([first_name, last_name])

7. Create a pandas DataFrame from the extracted names list:
df = pd.DataFrame(names, columns=['FirstName', 'LastName'])

8. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file named "players_name.csv":
df.to_csv('players_name.csv', index=False)
